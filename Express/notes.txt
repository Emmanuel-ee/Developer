Express is a server side tool, used to make server services.
Express surports making rest services.
Rest services mostly exposes data in the form of JSON.
JSON stands for javascript object notation
JSON is a means of transfering DATA Uusing KEY value Pair.
EXAMPLE OF JSON {"name": "john", "age":19}
Express is a framework which supports making web applications
To create a node js project, we have to fire " npm init --y "
This creates a Package.JSON
In Package.JSON, we can store various dependencies.
Downloading the express Dependencies, " npm i express "

"node server.js" to run server
express server has different method mappings
Example: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE .
GET is used for fetching the data from the server.
POST is used for inserting the Data into the server.
PUT is used for updating the Data.
DELETE is for deleting the data from the server.


To use Express generator
**parametereg**
npx express-generator

**parametereg1**
npm init --y
npm i express
npm install -g nodemon

server.js

var express = require("express");
var app = express();
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  return response.send("Hello from " + request.query.name);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("server has started"));



nodemon server.js

in a Browser, pass "http://localhost:3000/?name=Emmanuel"  you can pass any name.

Parameter serves as input to the server.

In the POST request, the Data comes in the form of REQUESTBODY.
To get that data in server.js, we will have to make use of body-parser

var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
app.use( bodyParser.json() );       // to support JSON-encoded bodies
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({     // to support URL-encoded bodies
  extended: true
}));

For post request we will have to pass the data in the form of JSON.
for doing that in POSTMAN, we have to select the Body and within the Body, select the typa as JSON

Routes
routing is a feature in express which allows to create different file and different mapping for different files.

userapi
user.js
var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();
const userdata = [];
router.get("/", (request, response) => {
  return response.json(userdata);
});

router.post("/", (request, response) => {
  let user = request.body;
  userdata.push(user);
  return response.json({ success: true });
});

router.get("/id", (request, response) => {
  let data = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < userdata.length; i++) {
    if (userdata[i].id == request.query.id) {
      data = userdata[i];
      break;
    }
  }
  console.log(data)
  return response.json(data);
});
module.exports = router

server.js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
app.use( bodyParser.json() );       // to support JSON-encoded bodies
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({     // to support URL-encoded bodies
  extended: true
}));

var user = require("./user")
app.use("/user", user)

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("server has started"));
